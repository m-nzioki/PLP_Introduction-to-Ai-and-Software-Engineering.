# Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

**1.Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry**
Software engineering is the process of designing, building, testing, and maintaining computer programs and applications.

Importance of software engineering in the technology industry:

- Quality Assurance: Proper software engineering practices ensure that software meets quality standards, functions correctly, and is reliable under various conditions.
- Cost Effectiveness: Well-engineered software reduces long-term costs by minimizing bugs, making maintenance easier, and extending the software's lifespan.
- Scalability: Engineered software can adapt to changing requirements and growing user bases.
- Complexity Management: As software systems become increasingly complex, engineering principles help manage this complexity through structured approaches.
- Industry Standards: Software engineering establishes standardized processes that enable collaboration across teams and organizations.
- Innovation Enablement: Good engineering practices create a stable foundation upon which innovation can be built.

2.Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.  
| Milestone	| Description |	Impact |
| --------- | ----------- | ------ |
| 1968 – NATO Conference on Software Engineering | The term "Software Engineering" was first coined. |	Established software engineering as a formal discipline. |
| 1970 – Waterfall Model | Introduced by Winston Royce as a structured software development approach. |	Provided a sequential and systematic method for software development. |
| 2001 – Agile Manifesto | A set of principles advocating for iterative and collaborative software development. | Revolutionized software development by prioritizing flexibility and customer collaboration. |

3.List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
**Requirement Analysis:** Gather and document business needs and user expectations.
**Planning:**	Define scope, timeline, and resources required.
**Design:**	Create architecture, system models, and user interfaces.
**Development:**	Actual coding of the software based on design specifications.
**Testing:**	Identify and fix defects to ensure quality.
**Deployment**	Release software for users.
**Maintenance:**	Ongoing updates and bug fixes after deployment.

4. Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
| Feature	| Waterfall	| Agile |
| ------- | --------- | ----- |
| Approach | Sequential, phase-based	| Iterative, incremental |
| Flexibility |	Rigid, changes are difficult |	Highly flexible, accommodates changes |
| Customer Involvement |	Minimal after requirement gathering	| Continuous feedback and collaboration |
| Testing Phase |	Happens after development	| Happens throughout development |
| Best for |	Well-defined projects with fixed requirements |	Dynamic projects where requirements evolve |
| Example Use Case |	Developing medical software with strict regulations |	Building a startup MVP that needs iterative refinement |

5. Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


6. Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


7. What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

8. Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


# Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

1. Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


2. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
