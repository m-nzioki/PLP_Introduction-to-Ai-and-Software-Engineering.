| Milestone	| Description |	Impact |
| --------- | ----------- | ------ |
| 1968 – NATO Conference on Software Engineering | The term "Software Engineering" was first coined. |	Established software engineering as a formal discipline. |
| 1970 – Waterfall Model | Introduced by Winston Royce as a structured software development approach. |	Provided a sequential and systematic method for software development. |
| 2001 – Agile Manifesto | A set of principles advocating for iterative and collaborative software development. | Revolutionized software development by prioritizing flexibility and customer collaboration. |

**3.List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.**

- **Requirement Analysis:** Gather and document business needs and user expectations.
- **Planning:**	Define scope, timeline, and resources required.
- **Design:**	Create architecture, system models, and user interfaces.
- **Development:**	Actual coding of the software based on design specifications.
- **Testing:**	Identify and fix defects to ensure quality.
- **Deployment**	Release software for users.
- **Maintenance:**	Ongoing updates and bug fixes after deployment.

**4. Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.**

| Feature	| Waterfall	| Agile |
| ------- | --------- | ----- |
| Approach | Sequential, phase-based | Iterative, incremental |
| Flexibility |	Rigid, changes are difficult |	Highly flexible, accommodates changes |
| Customer Involvement |	Minimal after requirement gathering	| Continuous feedback and collaboration |
| Testing Phase |	Happens after development	| Happens throughout development |
| Best for |	Well-defined projects with fixed requirements |	Dynamic projects where requirements evolve |
| Example Use Case |	Developing medical software with strict regulations |	Building a startup MVP that needs iterative refinement |

**5. Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.**

**Software Developer**
Software developers are the technical creators who write, debug, and maintain code. 
Their responsibilities include:
- Translating design specifications into functional code
- Implementing features and functionality according to requirements
- Writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code
- Debugging and fixing software issues
- Collaborating with other developers through code reviews and pair programming
- Unit testing their code to ensure it functions as intended
- Staying current with programming languages, frameworks, and development tools
- Documenting code and technical processes

**Quality Assurance Engineer**
QA engineers ensure that software meets quality standards and functions as expected. 
Their responsibilities include:
- Creating and executing test plans based on requirements
- Designing and implementing manual and automated test cases
- Identifying, documenting, and tracking defects
- Verifying bug fixes and performing regression testing
- Ensuring the software meets functional and non-functional requirements
- Advocating for quality throughout the development process
- Developing and maintaining testing frameworks and tools
- Collaborating with developers to improve quality early in the process

**Project Manager**
Project managers oversee the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects. 
Their responsibilities include:
- Defining project scope, objectives, and deliverables
- Creating and maintaining project schedules and budgets
- Allocating resources and managing team workload
- Facilitating communication among team members and stakeholders
- Managing risks and addressing issues that arise during development
- Tracking project progress and reporting status to stakeholders
- Ensuring alignment between technical work and business objectives
- Leading team meetings and promoting collaboration
- Managing change requests and scope adjustments


**6. Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.**

| Tool Type |	Definition | Examples |	Importance |
| --------- | ---------- | -------- | ---------- |
| Integrated Development Environment (IDE)	| Software suite that provides coding, debugging, and testing tools. |	VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm	| Enhances productivity by offering syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and debugging tools. |
| Version Control System (VCS)	| Tracks and manages changes to code over time.	| Git, SVN, Mercurial	| Enables collaboration, rollback to previous versions, and branch management. |

**7. What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.**

| Challenge | Description | Strategies to Overcome |
|-----------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Changing Requirements** | Requirements frequently change during development, causing rework and scope creep | • Adopt agile methodologies<br>• Implement iterative development cycles<br>• Use prototyping to validate requirements early<br>• Maintain a prioritized product backlog<br>• Establish clear change control processes |
| **Technical Debt** | Shortcuts taken during development accumulate, making future changes more difficult and expensive | • Allocate time for refactoring in each cycle<br>• Establish coding standards and best practices<br>• Implement continuous integration and automated testing<br>• Schedule regular code reviews<br>• Create a technical debt inventory |
| **Communication Barriers** | Miscommunication between technical and non-technical stakeholders leads to misaligned expectations | • Use visual models and prototypes<br>• Establish regular stakeholder meetings<br>• Create a common vocabulary<br>• Document decisions and rationale<br>• Practice active listening |
| **Knowledge Management** | Critical knowledge concentrated in few individuals, creating single points of failure | • Document processes and architecture<br>• Implement pair programming and mentoring<br>• Create wikis or knowledge bases<br>• Rotate responsibilities across the team<br>• Conduct knowledge-sharing sessions |
| **Estimating Accurately** | Software projects are notoriously difficult to estimate accurately | • Break work into smaller tasks<br>• Use historical data for estimates<br>• Apply team-based estimation techniques<br>• Track actual vs. estimated time<br>• Add contingency for unknown factors |
| **Integration Challenges** | Components developed separately often face challenges when integrated | • Implement continuous integration<br>• Create comprehensive integration tests<br>• Define clear interfaces between components<br>• Use feature flags for controlled deployment<br>• Conduct regular system-wide testing |

**8. Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.**

| Testing Type | Description | Importance |
| ------------ | ----------- | ---------- |
| Unit Testing | Tests individual components of the software.	| Ensures each module works as intended. |
| Integration Testing	 | Tests interactions between integrated components. | Verifies data flow and communication between modules. |
| System Testing |	Tests the complete system as a whole.	| Ensures end-to-end functionality meets business requirements. |
| Acceptance Testing | Validates software against user expectations. | Confirms if the software is ready for deployment. |


# Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
